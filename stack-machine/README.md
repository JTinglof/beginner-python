# Stack Machine

This goal of this project was to learned about python by creating a stack machine data structure that 
could read instructions from a text file.

## Files Included 

* prog4_1.py - a program that, when given a text file through the command line,
can tokenize the contents by whitespace and return them separated by a ",".

* StackMachine.py - a class that creates a StackMachine like data structure with 
methods for pushing and popping the stack as well as math functions that will add
or subtract the two top values on the stack.

* prog4_2.py - reads a text file like prog4_1 but will then check the contents for 
StackMachine commands. If it finds any it will create a StackMachine object and 
populate it acccording to the instructions on the text file.

## Usage

In the command line type:

> python prog4_[version number] [yourfile].txt
